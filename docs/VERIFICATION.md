# HiramShot verification record

- TypeScript noEmit: passed.
- Unit/security checks: 11 passed. Coverage includes every exact rate tier and day 6/7 boundaries; combo and add-ons; minimum reservation/deposit-credit arithmetic; invalid catalogs, selections and dates; upload spoofing/size/script checks; metadata removal; signature validation; contract file SHA-256; RFC 6238 TOTP vectors.
- SQLite schema and security checks: passed. Concurrent-overlap attempt rolls back every row in the bundle. Audit UPDATE and DELETE are blocked by append-only triggers.
- Local HTTP checks: 13 routes/cases passed, including anonymous customer/admin/document denial, cross-origin write denial, retired endpoints and disabled unconfigured KYC.
- Production dependency audit after upgrades: zero reported vulnerabilities at check time. This does not establish absence of undisclosed vulnerabilities.
- Browser QA: phone and tablet overflow checks; responsive menu; equipment filter; navigation into the rental calculator; desktop visual review. Browser automation did not provide a reliable full form submission; the live end-to-end customer/admin workflow remains unverified pending production service setup.
- Agreement PDF: generated test-only sample; three pages rendered and visually inspected, including original logo, English terms, signature and hash. No real signature or customer documents used.
- Production build: run through Sites workflow before packaging.

Known incomplete configuration and operational checks are in OPERATIONS.md. Do not present this private build as independently certified, fully production-ready, or as having an active auto-purge schedule.
